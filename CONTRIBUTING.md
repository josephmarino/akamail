## I want to help out, how can I do that?

Awesome! Thank you for wanting to contribute to AKA Mail and help modernize this very old codebase. A lot of work is needed to modernize AKA Mail, so all types of contributions are welcome, including code, documentation improvements, bug reports, and new feature suggestions.

## How do I contribute?

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository

2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) the repository to your computer

3. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches) in your fork; this is where your contribution will go

4. Make your changes

5. Add a git commit message. Your git commit body message should describe why you made the changes. [Here are some guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for writing great git commit messages.

7. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github) your changes to your fork's branch

7. [Submit a Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/josephmarino/akamail/compare)

    If you are not sure what to write in your pull request title and description, we suggest checking out ["The (written) unwritten guide to pull requests"](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/written-unwritten-guide-pull-requests) by Blake Riosa at Atlassian. 

8. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.

9. Celebrate after your pull request has been merged!

## I have an idea for a new feature, how do I share it?

If you would like to share an idea for a new feature please [open a new issue ticket](https://github.com/josephmarino/akamail/issues/new) and tag the ticket with the "enhancement" tag.

## I don't want to contribute, I just have a question.

Cool! You can [open a new issue ticket](https://github.com/josephmarino/akamail/issues/new) and tag it with the "help" tag and ask for help. Please keep in mind that as of the time of writing this sentence, AKA Mail does not have an active community of developers, so it may take some time to respond to your question. 

It is always recommend that everyone read the AKA Mail documentation first before opening a ticket with a question, as the answer that you are looking for could be in the documentation.
